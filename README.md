The development of methods for prediction of mortality rates in Intensive Care Unit (ICU) populations has been motivated primarily by the need to compare the efficacy of medications, care guidelines, surgery, and other interventions when, as is common, it is necessary to control for differences in severity of illness or trauma, age, and other factors.
The data used for the challenge consist of records from 12,000 ICU stays.ICU stays of less than 48 hours have been excluded.Up to 42 variables were recorded at least once during the first 48 hours after admission to the ICU.Not all variables are available in all cases, however. Six of these variables are general descriptors (collected on admission), and the remainder are time series, for which multiple observations may be available.Each observation has an associated time-stamp indicating the elapsed time of the observation since ICU admission in each case, in hours and minutes.
